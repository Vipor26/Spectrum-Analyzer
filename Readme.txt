This project is split up into features.

Spectrum analyzer
Clock, why not
All supporting code


Motivation - make code extremely simple to add on, would be nice for community to contribute back.


TODO:
 - Finish rewriting the code into its nice little compartments (files)
 - Fix clock
 - Fix FFT, window?
 - Build prototype, and stop using hack job
 - Menu items for remote interface
 - Have way for classes to report their parameters to the menu system.
 - Finish rewrite of adc.h to read stereo instead of using mix circuit. 


Done
